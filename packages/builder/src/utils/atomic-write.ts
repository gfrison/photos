/**
 * Atomically and durably write a file.
 *
 * Writes to a uniquely-named temporary file in the SAME directory (so the
 * final `rename` is a same-filesystem, atomic operation), fsyncs the data to
 * disk, then renames it into place. A crash or kill mid-write can therefore
 * never leave a partially-written / truncated destination file — readers see
 * either the old contents or the complete new contents, never a torn file.
 *
 * This matters for artifacts like `photos-manifest.json`: a torn manifest is
 * unparseable JSON, so the lenient loader discards the cache and the next
 * build pays a full rebuild; worse, a deploy that reads the torn file fails
 * the web build's `assertManifest` gate outright.
